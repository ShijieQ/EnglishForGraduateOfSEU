## Writing Skills

### Citing Previous Research

- **Information prominent citation** 信息突出型引用
  - the information is given primary importance 突出信息
  - focus on the information provided by the author
  - **E.g.** For viscoelastic fluids, the behavior of the time-dependent stresses in the transient shear flows is also very important **(Boger et al., 1994)**. 
- **Author prominent citation** 作者突出型引用
  - serves as the subject of the sentence 作为句子的主语
  - followed by the year in parentheses 后面跟括号里的年份
  - **E.g.** **Close (1983)** developed a simplified theory using an analogy between heat and mass transfer and the equivalent heat transfer only case.
- **Weak author prominent citation** 弱作者突出型引用
  - The cited author pointed out at the end that the subject part is referred to by pronouns 引用的作者在末尾指出，主语部分用代词指代
  - **E.g.** **Several authors** have reported ... **(Nguyen, 2005; Smith, 2000; Wilson, 2003)**.

Author prominent citation can be either strong or weak, depending on how much emphasis is placed on the identity of the author. 作者突出型引用可以是强引用，也可以是弱引用，这取决于对作者身份的重视程度。

### Relating Literature to Your Research

A literature review is a report or overview of literature found relevant to an area of research or study.

文献综述是对发现的与某一研究或研究领域相关的文献的报告或概述。

It provides an overview of the current literature that is available on a given subject, usually in academia.

### Avoid Plagiarism

Three ways to be used to avoid plagiarism: **Quoting**, **Paraphrasing** and **Summarizing**.

避免剽窃的三种方法：**引用**、**意译**和**总结**。

**Difference between paraphrasing and Summarizing**: the size of the eventual result.

**意译和总结的区别**：最终文字长度的长短。

A summary is much shorter than an original passage while a paraphrase is almost as long as or even longer than the original passage.

总结比原文短得多，而意译则几乎和原文一样长，甚至更长。

#### Paraphrasing

# Unit 4: Methodology Description

The method section is the most important aspect of a research paper because it provides the information by which the validity of a study is ultimately judged.

方法部分是研究论文最重要的方面，因为它提供了最终判断研究有效性的信息。

Methodology is the systematic, theoretical analysis of the methods applied to a field of study, or the theoretical analysis of the body of methods and principles associated with a branch of knowledge. It is the systematic study of methods that are, can be, or have been applied within a discipline. It is the study or description of methods. (Wikipedia)

方法论是对应用于某一研究领域的方法进行系统的理论分析，或对与某一知识分支相关的方法和原则进行理论分析。它是对一门学科中正在、可以或已经应用的方法的系统研究。它是对方法的研究或描述。（维基百科）

## Requirement

## Language Style

### Passive Voice

Passive structures have less subjective coloring. 被动结构含有较少的主观色彩。

| **Information elements** | **Verbs using the passive voice**                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Sample collection        | *was  performed, was designed, to be associated, were recruited* |
