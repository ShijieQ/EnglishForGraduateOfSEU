## Unit 4: Methodology Description

The method section is the most important aspect of a research paper because it provides the information by which the validity of a study is ultimately judged.

方法部分是研究论文最重要的方面，因为它提供了最终判断研究有效性的信息。

Methodology is the systematic, theoretical analysis of the methods applied to a field of study, or the theoretical analysis of the body of methods and principles associated with a branch of knowledge. It is the systematic study of methods that are, can be, or have been applied within a discipline. It is the study or description of methods. (Wikipedia)

方法论是对应用于某一研究领域的方法进行系统的理论分析，或对与某一知识分支相关的方法和原则进行理论分析。它是对一门学科中正在、可以或已经应用的方法的系统研究。它是对方法的研究或描述。（维基百科）

### Requirement

The experiment could be repeated by others to evaluate whether the results are reproducible, and the readers can judge whether the results and conclusions are valid.

其他人可以重复该实验，以评估结果是否可重复，读者可以判断结果和结论是否有效。

- a clear and precise description of how an experiment 对实验如何进行的清晰而精确的描述
- the rationale for the specific experimental procedures chosen 所选具体实验程序的基本原理

### Elements

### Data 

#### Type

	<tr>
	    <th>Perspective</th>

	    <td rowspan="2">the way of collection</td>
	    <td>primary data 主要数据</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>secondary data 次要数据</td>

	<tr>
	    <td rowspan="2">the nature of data</td>
	    <td>quantitative data 定量数据</td>

	</tr>
</table>

#### Collection Methods

### Language Style

#### Passive Voice

Passive structures have less subjective coloring. 被动结构含有较少的主观色彩。

| **Information elements** | **Verbs using the passive voice**                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Sample collection        | *was  performed, was designed, to be associated, were recruited* |
| Procedure                | *were  collected, were frozen, were analyzed*                |
| Materials                | *was  designed, was performed, was measured, was incubated, were extracted* |
| Data  analysis           | *was  performed, was used, are divided into, were assigned, were calculated* |

#### Sequential Markers

A process paragraph explains how to do sth or how sth works. Process paragraphs are usually developed step-by-step in a **chronological** or **logical** sequence. 

过程部分解释如何做某事或某事如何工作，通常按**时间顺序**或**逻辑顺序**逐步展开。

- To begin with..., First of all... etc.
- Secondly..., Next..., After that..., In addition... etc.
- Finally..., Lastly... etc.
