    - **Shock Opening:** This type of opening can really make an audience sit up and take notice, but make sure you can carry it off confidently. If you have any doubts opt for a safer more conventional opening
    - **Historical: **Relating your presentation to some relevant historical fact eg '15 years ago this company consisted of 2 men and a very old and unreliable press. Today it is a thriving organisation employing 270 people and with a turnover of 43 million pounds
